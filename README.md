# GPS-Map-Route-Planner-on-Embedded-Linux
Developed an embedded navigation system on an ARM board that loads campus map data, displays real-time GPS latitude/longitude, and calculates routes between start and end points. Implemented a graph-based road network and used the Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm for shortest path calculation.
